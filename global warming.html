            Global warming, also known as climate change, is the increase in the average temperature of Earth's atmosphere and its oceans. This is primarily caused by the release of heat-trapping gases, primarily carbon dioxide (CO2), into the atmosphere. The most recent major assessment of the IPCC reports that global warming is highly likely.

            There are many ways that global warming can manifest itself. These include rising sea levels due to the melting of ice caps and glaciers, extreme weather events like heatwaves and storms, and loss of biodiversity due to changing ecosystems. The magnitude and effects of global warming depend on factors such as the rate of greenhouse gas emissions, the absorption and reflectivity of solar radiation by Earth's atmosphere and oceans, and the rate of global cooling by natural processes such as volcanic eruptions and oceanic cycles.
